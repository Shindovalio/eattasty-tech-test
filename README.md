# Prototype web app for EatTasty
Basically: What will be needed is a technical exercise that has to do with EatTasty. Which has to do with selling and delivering food.

A small webapp, mobileapp, etc.

Examples:

Product list + checkout and purchase;

Delivery management (e.g. GPS tracking of couriers);

Another interesting idea around the subject.

Recommendations:

Backend: Preferably in NodeJS, but if you are more comfortable with other languages (e.g. PHP, C#, JAVA) we will also accept

FrontEnd: Preferably in Bootstrap, React could be used (or other technology they are more comfortable with)

Data: Preferably with access to a database (e.g. MongoDB) - Alternatively can be static JSON 'mockup' files

Code delivery - can be by a repository on GitHub or Gitlab.

Proofreading deadline: Give 3-5 days to perform the proof
